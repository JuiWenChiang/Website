I have experience in both graphic and three-dimensional art, and I have merged the creativity of art with the practicality of technology.I enjoy learning and trying new things, which is why I pursued a career in lighting design in China from scratch, eventually successfully completing a prominent restaurant's lighting design project. I also decided to work and holiday in Australia after sharing life experiences with friends. Furthermore, my interest in artificial intelligence led me to take a course and work as an engineer in the field. Additionally, I started learning to play the guzheng (a traditional Chinese musical instrument) after being deeply moved by a piece of music.",

I prefer to organize my work effectively and systematically. In times of technical and work-related challenges, I can remain calm under pressure and find the best solutions. Combining my previous experiences, I am also focused on delivering a comfortable user experience.",
        "life": "My life is incredibly diverse. In my free time, you might find me wandering through streets, flower markets, shops, mountains, or beaches. I could be in a classroom, learning new skills, exploring different cultures on the streets of a foreign country, chatting with people at a coffee shop, or staying at home and creating illustrations.",
        "summary": "I place a strong emphasis on expressing emotions and pursuing innovative ideas. My life is a never-ending adventure.
